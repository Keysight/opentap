## Contribute to OpenTAP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenTAP. Contributions include feature enhancement requests, issue reporting, bug fixes, etc.

This guide contains details on how to contribute to OpenTAP in a way that makes it most efficient for everyone.

## Contributor License Agreement

OpenTAP requires contributors to sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA), which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.opentap.io/docs/OpenTAP%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20v2.pdf).
The CLA can be signed either by an individual or a company. For companies, please be sure to include the company name and have a legal authorized representative endorse the document.

* By submitting code as an **individual** you agree to the individual contributor license agreement.

* By submitting code as a **company/entity** you agree to the corporate contributor license agreement.

Sign the CLA and forward it to [CLA@opentap.io](mailto:CLA@opentap.io) along with your GitLab username and your e-mail address. 

> **Note:** Making minor fixes, such a correcting typos and editing non-critical information, can be accepted from anyone without a formal CLA in place. All other issues will require a CLA to be signed and submitted.

## Contibuting Code

Once you have signed the CLA, we will accept pull requests containing fixes and enhancements to OpenTAP code and/or documentation.

In the issue tracker, the label `Accepting Merge Requests` indicates that we explicitly agree that the issue is valid and that we are looking for help creating a PR (other enhancements are also welcome).

Issues labeled `To be Discussed` require further discussion. Do your best to resolve these discussions, and get the label removed, before starting to work on these issues.

Once you have identified an issue:

1. Identify an existing issue you want to work on, or submit a new issue
1. Seek consensus on the idea (to make it easier to make a PR that the maintainers will agree with in the first go)
1. Assign it to yourself
2. Fork the repo
3. develop and test and commit changes
4. Submit a pull request back to [the root of the fork network](https://github.com/opentap/opentap)
