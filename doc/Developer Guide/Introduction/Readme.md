Introduction
============
This document describes the programmatic interface to OpenTAP and shows how to get started using OpenTAP for implementing test steps, instrument plugins, DUT plugins and result listeners.

## Audience
This document is written for **C# programmers** who are developing OpenTAP plugins or integrating OpenTAP into their own applications. It is not a reference manual, but rather a document that describes the principles behind OpenTAP and how to use its most important features from a programmer's perspective. If you are looking for Python developer documentation, go [here](https://doc.opentap.io/OpenTap.Python/).

Development requires the following software:

- Visual Studio 2022 or above
- OpenTAP 

## Suggested Resources
VISA driver e.g. Keysight I/O libraries for instrument communication
### PathWave Test Automation
Together with OpenTAP it is recommended to use a Graphical User Interface. Keysight Technologies offers both an enterprise and community version of [PathWave Test Automation Developer's System](https://www.keysight.com/find/tapinstall) that provides a highly flexible graphical user interface and code examples.
